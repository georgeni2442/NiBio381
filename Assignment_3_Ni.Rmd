# Question 1 

The primary reason for using Excel to set up data frames is that people like to have the columns aligned. However, if there are not too many columns, it may be faster to do the job in a plain text editor first and align the columns with tabs. In your text editor, type in (or copy and paste from here) the following lines of text:

```1. Reg Exp: Find:\s{3,}  Replace:,```

# Question 2
Write a single regular expression that will make the change.
```2. Reg Exp: Find: (\w+),( \s*)(\w+),(\s*)(.*)  Replace:  \3 \1 \(\5\)```

# Question 3 
A Second True Regex Story. A few weeks ago, at Radio Beanâ€™s Sunday afternoon old-time music session, one of the mandolin players gave me a DVD with over 1000 historic recordings of old-time fiddle tunes.

```3. Reg Exp: Find: \.\w{2}\d\s  Replace: .mp3\n```

# Question 4
Now write a regular expression to grab the four digit number and put it at the end of the title:
```4. Reg Exp: Find:(\d+)\s.*\.\w{2}\d Replace: \2_\1.mp3```

# Question 5
Here is a data frame with genus, species, and two numeric variables.

```5. Reg Exp: Find: (\w)\w+,(\w+),\d{1,}\.\d,(\d+) Replace: \1_\2,\3```

# Question 6
Beginning with the original data set, rearrange it to abbreviate the species name like this:

```6. Reg Exp: Find: (\w)\w+,(\w{4})\w+,\d{1,}\.\d,(\d+) Replace: \1_\2,\3```

# Question 7
Beginning with the original data set, rearrange it so that the species and genus names are fused with the first 3 letters of each, followed by the two columns of numerical data in reversed order:

```7. Reg Exp: Find: (\w{3})\w+,(\w{3})\w+,(\d{1,}\.\d),(\d+) Replace: \1\2, \4, \3```
